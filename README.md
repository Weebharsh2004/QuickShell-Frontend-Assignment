# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is created using Create React App, a widely used tool for setting up React applications quickly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the documentation for more information on running tests.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready for deployment!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the default build tool and configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.

You don't need to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small to medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature unless necessary.
